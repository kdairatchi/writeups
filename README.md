# Bug Bounty Writeups & Reports Library

Single repo for kdairatchi's local bug bounty writeups, disclosed reports, methodology notes, and Medium feed tracking.

## Start Here

- [Reports](reports/index.html) - disclosed report datasets from `/home/anon/bounty-reports-data`.
- [Writeups](writeups/index.html) - curated writeup lists and target/platform collections.
- [Medium/Methodology/Searchable Library](index.html) - the GitHub Pages view for the Medium feed, methodology notes, and manifest-backed search.
- [reports/INDEX.md](reports/INDEX.md) - source-by-source report inventory.
- [writeups/INDEX.md](writeups/INDEX.md) - source-by-source writeup inventory.
- [MANIFEST.json](MANIFEST.json) - machine-readable counts, byte totals, suffix breakdowns, and source mapping.

The GitHub Action writes the Medium feed to `writeups/medium-feed.md`, then regenerates this README and the category indexes from `MANIFEST.json`. It should never pipe feed output directly over the root README.

Do not delete the old source data until this repo has been reviewed, committed, pushed, and checked on GitHub.
